# ARCase
AR Project <br/>
**Purpose** <br/>
The purpose of the project is to allow users to create an immersive world for themselves using the objects in their inventory.

**How does it work?** <br/>
 Click on the build file<br/>
 
**Technologies **<br/>
Developed using AR Foundation and Unity.<br/>

**Features**<br/>
When you launch the application, the camera opens and  a background sound is heard. <br/>
There are two types of objects. Objects can be dragged and added to the AR world. <br/>
One type of object can be freely dragged and placed anywhere. The other type spawns when vertical or horizontal surfaces are detected. <br/>
You can also replace these objects by selecting a different type from the inventory. <br/>
While dragging an object, it has an outline effect around it which disappears when you release it.<br/>
If you successfully place the objects, they emit a unique sound associated with each object.<br/>
If no suitable plane is detected where you release the object, it returns to the inventory.<br/>
